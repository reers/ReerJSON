# ReerJSON
## A faster version of JSONDecoder based on [yyjson](https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson)

![Coverage: 88%](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=coverage&message=88%&color=brightgreen)
[![SwiftPM compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/SwiftPM-compatible%20%28iOS%29-brightgreen)](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

ReerJSON is a really fast JSON parser, and it's inspired by [ZippyJSON](https://github.com/michaeleisel/ZippyJSON) and [Ananda](https://github.com/nixzhu/Ananda).

> **⚠️Important:** When measuring the performance of Swift libraries, make sure you're building in **Release Mode**. 
> When building Swift code on DEBUG compilation, it can be 10-20x slower than equivalent code on RELEASE.

### Lower than iOS 17

Tested with ReerJSON 0.3.0, ZippyJSON 1.2.15, IkigaJSON 2.3.2

# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

Add dependency in `Package.swift` or project `Package Dependencies`
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/reers/ReerJSON.git", from: "0.3.0"),
```

Depend on `ReerJSON` in your target.
```swift
.product(name: "ReerJSON", package: "ReerJSON" ),
```

# Usage
Just replace `JSONDecoder` with `ReerJSONDecoder` wherever you want to use it. So instead of `let decoder = JSONDecoder()`, do `let decoder = ReerJSONDecoder()`, and everything will just work. This is because `ReerJSONDecoder` has the exact same API as `JSONDecoder`. Also, don't forget to add `import ReerJSON` in files where you use it.

# Differences
| Decoder Diff              | Foundation |ReerJSON                   |
|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| JSON5                     | ✅         | ✅                        |                       
| assumesTopLevelDictionary | ✅         | ❌                        |
| Infinity and NaN          | ±Infinity, ±NaN | ±Infinity, ±NaN, ±Inf and case-insensitive. See [details](https://github.com/reers/ReerJSON/blob/main/Tests/ReerJSONTests/JSONEncoderTests.swift#L1975) |
